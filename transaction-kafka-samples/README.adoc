== Spring Cloud Stream Sample Transactional Application

This sample is showing how you can get a transactional producer using Kafka.

The flow is as follows

1. POST request with /<name> to :9997
2. transaction-http-source put on kafka topic person-event
3. transaction-spring-data-processor
a. listen to topic person-event
b. create new person entity and save to maria db
c. create a new person saved event and put on topic person-command
d. all this as a single transaction
4. transaction-logger-sink litsen to person-command and log out

In order to test the example name is a uniq field. Sending the same name twice should not be allowed
Example using httpie
```
http :9997 name=TonyStark
```

With transactional on this message will now NOT be removed from the incomming queue if the write to the database fails.
