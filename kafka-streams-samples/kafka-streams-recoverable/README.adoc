== What is this app?

This is an example of a Spring Cloud Stream processor using Kafka Streams support.

This is a demonstration of utilizing the RecordRecoverableProcessor and DltAwareProcessor.

The example increments a java.util.Suppler integer by 1 every 2 seconds, and publishes
to the `topic-in` kafka topic.

There's then two processors, both of which are listening on `topic-in`.

The first processor throws an exception in the workflow when the integer is divisible by 5.
The second processor throws an exception in the workflow when the integer is divisible by 4.

This sample uses lambda expressions and thus requires Java 8+.

=== Running the app:

`docker-compose up -d`

Go to the root of the repository and do: `./mvnw clean package`

`java -jar target/kafka-streams-recoverable-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

The Supplier will automatically publish messages and the consumers
will write messages to the application log.
