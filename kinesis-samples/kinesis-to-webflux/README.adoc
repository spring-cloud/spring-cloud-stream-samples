== Reactive Spring Cloud Stream AWS Kinesis Binder to SSE via WebFlux

This sample demonstrate a simple bridging of AWS Kinesis stream records to the Server Side Events subscribers.
The `Consumer` sink side is based on the Spring Cloud Stream Reactive support, streaming incoming messages to the `Flux` argument which, in turn, is used as a source for the `@GetMapping` controller.

The `CloudStreamKinesisToWebfluxApplicationTests` demonstrates:

- an `AmazonKinesisAsync` client configured against local Kineselite on the `4568` port;
- the `Supplier` binding for producing records into the Kinesis stream;
- a `WebTestClient` to perform SSE request against embedded Netty started by the `CloudStreamKinesisToWebfluxApplication` Spring Boot application on the random port and subsequent verification of the data produced by the `Flux` from the `Consumer` against Kinesis Binder.
