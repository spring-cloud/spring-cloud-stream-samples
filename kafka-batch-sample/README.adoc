== What is this app?

This is an example of a Spring Cloud Stream demonstrating the processing of record batches.

The application simply upper-cases the input records and sends them to another topic.

=== Running the app:

Go to the root of the repository and do:

`docker-compose up -d` (if you don't already have a Kafka broker running locally).

`./mvnw clean package`

`java -jar target/kafka-batch-sample-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar `

There is a simple `@KafkaListener` method to display the records sent to the output topic.

When run with `java -jar target/kafka-batch-sample-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=transactional` the listener will suspend with

`Hit Enter to exit the listener and commit transaction`.

Pressing the enter key allows the listener to exit and the transaction will commit.

Only then will you see the output from the `@KafkaListener` because its consumer is configured with `isolation.level: read_committed`.
